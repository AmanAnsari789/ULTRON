 The main idea behind this project is for you to create a personal assistant that responds to
 voice commands, assisting with tasks like setting reminders, playing music, or even cracking
 jokes (similar to Alexa or Siri)

 
 
 This project involves creating a software application that understands and processes human
 speech, performs tasks, and responds in a human-like manner. Itâ€™s like giving life to a virtual
 being.
